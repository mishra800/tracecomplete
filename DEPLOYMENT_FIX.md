# 🚀 Deployment Fix Guide

## 🔴 Issues Found

Your deployed site at `https://tracenetwork.netlify.app/admin` is showing these errors:

1. **CORS Error**: Backend not accessible from production
2. **Network Error**: Frontend trying to call `localhost:5000` instead of production backend
3. **Missing Backend Deployment**: Server is not deployed anywhere

---

## ✅ Complete Fix (Step-by-Step)

### **Step 1: Deploy Backend Server to Render.com**

#### 1.1 Sign Up & Create Service
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign up (free tier available)
2. Click **"New +"** → **"Web Service"**
3. Choose **"Build and deploy from a Git repository"** OR **"Deploy from GitHub"**

#### 1.2 Configure Service
- **Name**: `trace-backend` (or any name you prefer)
- **Root Directory**: `server`
- **Environment**: `Node`
- **Build Command**: `npm install`
- **Start Command**: `node server.js`

#### 1.3 Add Environment Variables
Click **"Advanced"** → **"Add Environment Variable"** and add these:

```
PORT=5000
DB_HOST=mysql-2486df3a-abhishekmishra-bd19.i.aivencloud.com
DB_PORT=14765
DB_USER=avnadmin
DB_PASSWORD=AVNS_34xG3yyWPzg_2pIN56J
DB_NAME=defaultdb
DB_SSL=true
JWT_SECRET=supersecretjwtkey_replace_me
EMAIL_USER=yamunaatoms@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=cotd dkvd fsnw ypdh
```

#### 1.4 Deploy
1. Click **"Create Web Service"**
2. Wait 3-5 minutes for deployment
3. You'll get a URL like: `https://trace-backend-xyz.onrender.com`
4. **SAVE THIS URL** - you'll need it in the next step

### **Step 2: Update Netlify Environment Variables**

#### 2.1 Configure Netlify
1. Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Select your site (`tracenetwork`)
3. Go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
4. Click **"Add a variable"**

#### 2.2 Add Backend URL
- **Key**: `VITE_API_URL`
- **Value**: `https://YOUR-RENDER-URL.onrender.com/api`
  
  Replace `YOUR-RENDER-URL` with the actual URL from Step 1.4
  
  Example: `https://trace-backend-xyz.onrender.com/api`

5. Click **"Save"**

---

### **Step 3: Redeploy Frontend**

#### 3.1 Trigger Netlify Rebuild
1. In Netlify dashboard, go to **"Deploys"**
2. Click **"Trigger deploy"** → **"Deploy site"**
3. Wait for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)

#### 3.2 Verify Deployment
1. Visit `https://tracenetwork.netlify.app/admin`
2. Try logging in with:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin@123`
3. Check browser console (F12) - errors should be gone!

---

### **Step 4: Update CORS (Already Done)**

✅ I've already updated `server/server.js` to allow requests from:
- `https://tracenetwork.netlify.app`
- `https://tracenetwork.in`
- `http://localhost:5173` (for local development)

Make sure to push this change to your backend deployment.

## 🔧 Alternative: Deploy Backend to Railway.app

If Render doesn't work, try Railway:

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click **"Start a New Project"** → **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Select your repository
4. Railway will auto-detect Node.js
5. Add the same environment variables as above
6. Get your Railway URL (e.g., `https://trace-backend.up.railway.app`)
7. Update Netlify's `VITE_API_URL` with this new URL

---

## 📝 Quick Checklist

- [ ] Backend deployed to Render/Railway
- [ ] Backend URL saved (e.g., `https://trace-backend-xyz.onrender.com`)
- [ ] Netlify environment variable `VITE_API_URL` set to backend URL + `/api`
- [ ] Netlify site redeployed
- [ ] Login page tested and working
- [ ] Browser console shows no CORS errors

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Still getting CORS error"
**Solution**: 
1. Check that backend is running (visit `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/api/auth/me`)
2. Verify CORS origins in `server/server.js` include your Netlify domain
3. Redeploy backend after any changes

### Issue: "Login still fails"
**Solution**:
1. Open browser console (F12) → Network tab
2. Check the request URL - it should be your Render URL, not localhost
3. If it's still localhost, clear Netlify cache and redeploy

### Issue: "Backend takes long to respond"
**Solution**: 
- Render free tier sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after sleep takes 30-60 seconds
- Consider upgrading to paid tier or use Railway
